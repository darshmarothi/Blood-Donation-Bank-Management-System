# Blood-Donation-Bank-Management-System
The Blood Donation Bank Management System is a Python-based project designed to manage blood donation records effectively. My team and I developed it for the AISSCE 2022 examination, it provides an easy-to-use interface for donors and patients to register, update details, and check blood availability.
